# Proxy Getter

This simple python script which is using BeautifulSoup 4, gets you a list of proxies from websites such as free-proxy-list.net or us-proxy.org which use the same design (and source code, not sure if it's opensource or anything) because they require a payment if you want to have them in a format that's readable by programs.
